# This repository contains python implementation of 3D reconstruction from single image by finding the depth map of this image
Inspired by the following papers:
* [Depth Map Prediction from a Single Image using a Multi-Scale Deep Network by Eigen et al., NIPS 2014](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2283.pdf)
* [Depth Estimation from Single Image Using CNN-Residual Network](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/203.pdf)

Dataset from [NYU Depth Dataset V2](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html)
